# Analysis of Treadmill Company

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the data of a treadmill company using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy. The analysis includes various steps such as data exploration, outlier detection, examining the effect of different features on product purchases, calculating probabilities, customer profiling, and providing actionable insights for the business.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Import and Exploration:** Imported the dataset and examined its structure and characteristics.
2. **Outlier Detection:** Detected outliers using boxplots and the "describe" method, comparing mean and median.
3. **Effect of Features:** Investigated the impact of features like marital status and age on product purchases using visualizations such as countplots, histplots, and boxplots.
4. **Marginal Probability:** Calculated the marginal probability of customers purchasing different treadmill models (e.g., KP281, KP481, KP781) using pandas.crosstab.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Explored correlations among different factors using heatmaps or pair plots.
6. **Probability Calculation:** Determined the probability of a male customer buying a specific treadmill model (e.g., KP781).
7. **Customer Profiling:** Categorized users based on their characteristics.
8. **Recommendations:** Provided data-driven recommendations for the company to increase sales, focusing on actionable insights devoid of technical jargon.
